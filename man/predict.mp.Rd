\title{Prediction for a Fitted "mp" Object}
\usage{
\method{predict}{mp}(object, newx = NULL, weight = NULL, overall_rec = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted "mp" object returned by "mpersonalized"}

\item{newx}{Covariate matrix of new patients. If not supplied, by default the prediction
is for the original dataset in the "mp" object. Notice: when \code{problem = "meta-analysis"} and
the prediction is for the original dataset, subjects in each study are only predicted
using the treatment recommendation rule of the study they belong to.}

\item{weight}{A weight vector for the overall recommendation, only needed when \code{overall_rec = TRUE}.
By default, equal weights are assigned to each study/outcome.}

\item{overall_rec}{A logical value. If \code{overall_rec = TRUE}, an overall recommendation will
be provided as an weighted average of the optimal treatment from each individual study/outcome. Only useful
when \code{newx} is provided.}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
A list object of two elements.
.

\item{opt_treatment}{A list object with each element denoting the prediction based on a penalty parameter
configuration in \code{mp$penalty_parameter_sequence}. Specifically, if \code{newx} is provided,
each element is a recommendation matrix with each row denoting a subject and each column denoting
a study/outcome; otherwise, each element is a list of vectors with each vector representing the optimal treatment
for each study/outcome. If \code{overall_rec = TRUE},
the weighted overall recommended treatment will be further provided as well.
If the overall recommened treatment is equal to 0.5, it means the weighted sum is equal for 0 and 1.}
\item{benefit_score}{A list object of benefit scores computed from \eqn{g_1, \dots, g_K}. Similar structure as
\code{opt_treatment}.}
}
\description{
This function predicts optimal treatment of new subjects for a mpersonalized model.
If different rules are used in the fitting procedure, an overall treatment recommendation
based on all stuides/outcomes could be provided together with optimal treatments for
each study/outcome.
}
\details{
This function predicts for each penalty parameter in the
\code{penalty_parameter_sequence} of the "mp" object. The overall recommended treatment is
given as an weighted average of the recommended treatments from each study/outcome, and the weight
can be specified by user.
